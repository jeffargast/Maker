### RacingController
I repurposed a wireless RC controller for use as a game controller on my PC. I stripped all the electronics off the existing board except for the trim potentiometers, and then added an Arduino Micro. I wired up the steering wheel, trigger, and trims, and added 4 buttons that can be mapped on the PC.
